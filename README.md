# MJs_Dump_Pouch

Download latest stable release on Steam (Coming Soon)

# Description

MJ's Dump Pouch adds a realistic and functional dump pouch system to Arma 3, designed to integrate with ACE, ACM, and KAT Medical. It allows players to manage medical waste, spent magazines, and other small items, improving tactical awareness and realism.

Features

Medical Waste Management: Used bandages, gauze, and other medical items are automatically stored in the pouch instead of being dropped on the ground.

Universal Storage: Can hold small items like IO devices, used magazines, or other tactical gear.

Realistic Weight System: The pouch has weight but does not take up inventory space since it's attached to the belt.

ACE Integration: Supports ACE interaction menus for checking and emptying the pouch.

SSE & Tactical Cleanup: Prevents enemy tracking through discarded medical waste, enhancing stealth and OPSEC.

Requirements
